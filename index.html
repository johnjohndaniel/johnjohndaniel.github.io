            <h1>The year we became friends</h1>
            <p>I remember seeing you for the first time in room 420 in Whidden Hall. First thought: these girls have some wacky names. Mimsy and Mudd. Little did I know a week later we’d be fighting off deer while smoking weed in the field behind LP, and I’d be yelling ‘Miiiiiiiimsyyyyy’ from the top of a tree. The year started off strong with us hanging fairly frequently, but school seemed to get the best of us through the winter. Luckily we picked things back up and smoked a copious amount of shower bowls in your dorm mid-way through second semester. The year ended with a sense finale that writers could only dream of. Unfortunately it had to happen on your birthday, but thanks for taking one for the team! Ben and Hannah, Lila and I, Liam and Maddy getting kicked out. I still have a distinct memory of you screaming at the sight of everything going on. Fair enough, that was a shit show. But, it certainly is a great way to show off most of the cast of season 2! Who knew that would be the start of a lifelong friendship.</p>

            <h1>The year we grew closer</h1>
            <p>I didn’t quite know what to expect coming back from the summer and into second year. Would the gang get back together? Would we have the same connection as in first year? Would all the girls resent me for breaking it off with Lila 4 days into the school year? Luckily, you have an incredible skill for staying close to people you care about, and all you ladies were very forgiving of my actions. I’m glad that Ben, Liam, Aidan, and I fit into the category of people who you wanted to hang with. You ladies threw parties, invited us to events, and became our go-to drinking buddies. The guys house and the girls house. To this day, my parents still make the joke about me always hanging out with those ‘Maddynemily’ girls. That’s also probably around when my grandmother started shipping us. One of the first times that I remember us connecting on a deeper level was the evening of 12 bars when I went back with you to pick up your forgotten ID’s (classic Emily). You already know that my hero complex was peeking by helping my pretty friend make it safely back to the bar. I also saved you from a fairly awkward encounter with Ben that evening, so you’re welcome. It may have also been this year that we made that pact to get married if we were still single by 40. You see, I’ve been playing the long game with you ever since we were 19, and I plan to keep playing the game until we’re 90. We may have to expedite that marriage timeline though. Let’s agree to get married by 36 as long as no one snatches either of us up between now and then - deal?</p>

            <h1>The year I knew we'd be friends forever</h1>
            <p>For me, third year university was the year that I knew we’d all be lifelong friends. Many of the parties were a similar vibe, with the addition of an expanded crowd that included more of your iSci friends, Emerson, Dom, and a number of others who would come and go. Homecoming, Halloween, Christmas gift exchange. Despite the similar themes and parties, the vibes were completely different. We all felt far closer to one another and more mature. With Ben, Liam, and I leaving for exchange in second semester, we had far less time together than we all would have hoped. But distance makes the heart grow fonder, and I think the disappointment we all felt about being apart for so long was indicative of the strength of the friendships we’d developed over the past 2.5 years. The 5 of us, the OG gang, we truly did become the breakfast club that year. I have this one memory of the two of us walking through the streets of Hamilton talking about some of the projects that you had worked on in iSci. I think the whole gang was grabbing sushi or something. This was when I was seriously considering switching paths towards doing something in healthcare. I can’t understate how cool I thought the work you were doing was. Designing a mars mission. Doing forensics. So cool - I was blown away by how smart you were, even if I had to beg you to tell me about your school work. I’m still being blown away by the way you think about life and the way you work through problems. Never forget how bright you are and always remember to go easy on your easily persuaded boyfriend.</p>

            <h1>The time I saw you as a boss ass bitch</h1>
            <p>Seeing you at camp was an eye opening experience. For one, it was amazing to be able to put faces to the weird wacky camp friends that I’d been hearing so much about over the last few years. But the things that sticks out in my mind is seeing you in a leadership position. You fuckin ran that shit. Absolute head honcho on the block. You were dripping in BDE and you would tell how much the other staff and campers respected you. The other thing I noticed is that while most everyone else was going along doing their jobs, you took it upon yourself to set up the Suzuki Experience to teach the campers about the importance of sustainability. Em, you have such a strong sense of purpose - it’s infectious. You exemplify this image to this day. No matter what you end up doing in the future Em, whether it be in food systems, energy, consulting, at a large company, an NGO, a startup, at TOC, having a global impact or impacting people locally, I know you’re going to make an enormous dent on the planet and on the people you help. You are a force of change, I believe this in my core. You impact and inspire everyone around you - and you inspire me more than you know.</p>

            <p>This was an unfortunate year. You had a roommate from hell. You filmed me peeing my pants. I almost died from MCAT stress. COVID decimated the elderly. The only positive is that you pulled out SYYYYYNDROOOOME the greatest halloween costume I’ve every seen in my life (Side note, The Incredibles might be a sick halloween costume for us to do at some point. Food for thought). Of course the year wasn’t all bad, but the bottom line is that we were’t together. So let’s make sure that never happens again, capeesh?</p>

            <p>I need to mention this because (in Essex accent) girl you fiiiit then and you getting even fitter day by day. I certainly would crawl all over that fine looking body of yours every day of the week and any time you like. I took note of your bikinied body when we went camping in Algonquin the summer after you graduated, and I may have vibed out a few times to the thought of us banging after that experience. We took lake bowls together, a riveting and life changing experience in itself. Also, technically our first kiss was on this camping trip. Though I’m not counting this because I’m pretty sure you had eyes for a different boy at this time, but luckily I was playing the long game, building groundwork, and waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike.</p>

            <h1>The time we did shrooms and you changed my direction in life</h1>
            <p>When we did shrooms and walked through the forest, I remember you telling me about how the forest around the Hamilton escapement are older and more diverse than most forests. You told be about how a glacier rammed it’s way through the area that we were walking, which is what formed all the cliffs and valleys. I remember being honestly fascinated by what you knew about the different rocks and about what you could deduce about the history of an area purely by looking at it. I also remember thinking about how humble you were with sharing your knowledge. If I knew half of what you knew I’d be shouting it from the treetops. I don’t think I’ve ever told you this, but you were an enormous influence for why I shifted my focus from medicine towards environmental issues. When you spoke about what you were working on, I felt the urgency of the issue, but I also saw opportunity. You didn’t speak about environmental issues like we were completely doomed and out of options. You urged that this was an issue, but you had’t given up on finding solutions to the problems, like many people I’d spoke to about it. That period at the beginning of 5th year is when I realized that people needed to be working on solving these issues and that climate change was the biggest challenge of our generation. But Em truthfully, I don’t think I would have gone down the same path if you hadn’t been in my life. Thinking back to the person who influenced me the most to switch gears, it was you.</p>

            <h1>The year at Whitney</h1>
            <p>This year was obviously full of ups and downs. We were living in shit-hole rooms and I think it’s fair to say that our mental health was at an all-time low. I made a move on you and you shut me down. You made a move on me and I shut you down. There were some amazing times we all spent together. The parties, room crawls, you throwing it in a circle every weekend (my favourite time of the week), our tennis matches, our love island obsession, our bachelor watch parties, your delectable home-cooked meals, our darling child Yam, and lots of weed, to name a few positives. I also made quite a ruckus the night that Lena stayed over, which I’m thankful for because I think it likely peeked your curiosity about how I was as a lover. I’m also thankful about the relationship you had with Aidan. I think you grew so much as a person and learned many things about what you like in a partner. All in all, that experience had an influence on who you’ve become today and for that I’m so thankful. Above all else, the thing that sticks out in my mind from that year is how we supported each other and grew closer as friends. I think everyone in the house grew closer that year, but there was something about the way that yours and my relationship shifted that was special. I think we finally understood each other at the end of the year (though you’d probably argue that you knew me all along) and we gained an enormous amount of respect for one another. We both saw therapists, worked through some challenges that has been eating away at us, and we made changes in our lives to be better to ourselves. You were truly my best friend in the house. I still have a note that you wrote me at the end of the year where you say that I was your best friend in the house - I cherished this at the time and I still cherish it. I was admittedly somewhat heartbroken when at the end of the year I knew that there would be someone else who you’d be going to with your thoughts, but I was also happy that you were happy.</p>

I loved meeting all your sick Euro friends, doing molly for the first time, being mesmerized by the weeping willow swaying in the wind. It was great that you avoided shitting your pants and forcing us to leave the venue. But despite all these awesome moments, the best part of my night was when we were dancing just the two of us. In that moment the crowd seemed to disappear. It was just us. I think I may have even grabbed your hips at one point. Oh mama that was a rush. That pic we have of you on my shoulders will go down as one of the coolest pictures we have with one another, and you’re looking strikingly photogenic, as usual.</p>

            <h1>The romantic trip where we fell in love</h1>
            <p>I may have bailed on visiting you for King’s day, but thank god I did or else I doubt we’d be where we are today. We seriously need to make a rom-com about our story. Both of us independently talking to our friends about how taking a trip to Greece together is going to be super romantic and may cause us to fall in love… Talk about an incredible opening scene to a smash hit movie. The trip started off poorly, with you laughing hysterically at the enormous pain I was in after bonking my head outside Maria’s hotel. Luckily you were looking like the hottest lady I’d ever seen in my entire life wearing that navy blue sundress on our balcony. No exaggeration, I lust for you every single time I look back at those pictures. But despite the head injury setting us back, I charmed Maria into giving us medical care, and we rallied. One gyro, two shotguns, a few more casuals, and 27 hand rolled cigarettes later, we were feeling like a million bucks! I still have a permanent goose egg on my skull, but at least you offered to show me your boobs to make me feels better (I assume?). If i’d only known back then what I know now about your knockers, I definitely wouldn’t have acted nearly as much like a gentleman in that moment. Other moments that stick out to me is crushing our Ouzo-beers in Paros (a valued tradition that we continued across Greece), asking our handsome waiter to cut our fish for us, getting burned on the black sand beach (double meaning here because the sand was genuinely burning our feet, but you were also looking HOT as FUCK in that little purple piece), hiking to the highest point on Santorini and me heroically finding us a restaurant when you couldn’t stand to walk more than a couple more steps. We let our love for food run wild on that trip. I hope that our love for good food and cooking is something we share together for the rest of our lives. I also hope we introduce our friends to the wonders (and potentially detrimental effect) of back to back ouzo’s. All that said, the highlight of this trip for me was spending time with Vance and Anne in Crete. No lie, we earned the time of our lives after having the craziest time trying to rent a car to Crete. The parties, the hookah, carrying Emma to bed after a long night out, us resisting the urge to make out on your bunk bed. I think we may have vibed out to the thought of one another at pretty much the exact same time one of those nights - sexy. We’ll definitely be going back to Crete in our lifetimes. I want to travel everywhere with you. Together nothing can stop us baby, I believe this in my core. We balance each other as every couple should and we bounce off each other like every couple hopes for. Vance and Anne certainly saw this, which prompted their interrogation for why we weren’t together. The writing was on the wall, I suppose. The layover in Paris is when I started to crack. You were looking like a delicious cherry pie in that little dress of yours and papa couldn’t keep waist banding his dick while we were riding that electric scooter. I’m glad you stuck to your guns and told me to stop fondling your abs. I’m also glad you put your head on my shoulder on the 4AM train ride back to the airport. I think we were both in a state of denial post-Greece. I certainly was. Especially considering there were some loose ends that needed to be tied down back home. But we just had to let things play out as they were going to. I think that love is part effort and part luck, and we certainly lucked out with the timing of our trip to Greece.</p>

    <!-- The August we were ‘just physical’  -->

    <section class="features" id="features">
        <div class="heading">
            <h1>The August we were ‘just physical’</h1>
            <p>There’s no way around it, dealing with the fallout of hooking up was certainly challenging. Trying to rationalize to ourselves what we’d done, trying to be considerate of everyone’s feelings involved. Let’s just say that there were a lot of stakeholders. We had a love pentagon with Aidan, Lila, and Liam. We had Ben reminding us what terrible people we were. We had the guilt of potentially hurting our close friends. It was messy, but I think we did the best we could have done in that situation. We were honest with our feelings and we did what we thought felt right. Okay maybe the balcony sex was a little gutty but I mean come on can you blame me? You pull up to Aidan and Liam’s in this little tight hot pink skirt… the memory of seeing you through the balcony window at the beginning of the night is seared into my memory. I don’t know if you could see my face - no words can describe the jaw-drop that I experienced in that moment. I felt like the luckiest guy in the world (I still do, for the record). The only thing I wanted to do was grab you and kiss you like no had ever done before. But you fended off my advances, successfully avoiding all contact with me the whole night. It made the balcony experience later than night all the better. Me inching up to you in the middle of the night, alone at last, kissing you and fucking you over the balcony railing. August felt like a game of cat and mouse. I wasn’t expecting you to say that you wanted to be ‘just physical’, but I was up for the challenge. The second you said that to me, you saw my demeanour switch. In that moment my thoughts slowed and my internal dialogue was as follows: “Okay John, you may have just fucked things up here. You better act cool, calm, and collected for the next few weeks or you may lose this girl.” I’m not saying I was trying to date right away, but I remember immediately switching my thought process towards a more casual relationship after you said that. Luckily being ‘just physical’ didn’t bar us from hanging out as friends. I’m laughing thinking back to this period of time because it was definitely an adjustment for both of us to go from purely friends to friends who sometimes bang? It was a serious puzzle trying to understand when was an okay time for us to touch or cuddle, but I guess this is to be expected when the nature of your relationship with someone changes 6 years into knowing them. I think so fondly back to our voice note exchange one of the first nights after coming back from Toronto. I saw you in a completely different light that night. A sexier, more scandalous, and downright hilarious version of the Emily I knew. That was something special. It was basically the first time we’d flirted with one another, but it didn’t feel like the first time. By the way, I will let you win at Tennis any time you play in nothing but your sports bra. I’m glad August ended the way that it did. Those last couple days together in Ottawa were magical. We probably offended some art snobs by snogging every 2 minutes walking around that exhibit, but I didn’t care because this was the first time where I felt like we were a real couple. That time in downtown Ottawa was like the time at the park across the street. Legs felt like jello and we were just dancing around one another. Speaking of jello legs, we had some of the best sex we’d ever had that weekend. You standing up against the wall near my TV, then coming back down to the couch where you rode me from behind. Almost as delicious as the time next to your TV when I came up behind you and we quietly fucked as your mom made us pizza upstairs. Sex with you is the best I’ve had in my life and I have a burning appetite for more…</p>

        <div class="heading">
            <h1>The long distance relationship</h1>
            <p>Things were somewhat uncertain where we left things in August. I don’t remember for sure, but I believe we both felt that doing 8+ months of long distance seemed like a ridiculous idea. But luckily, I just couldn’t get enough of you, and you seemed to tolerate me long enough for our daily phone calls. Things started off pretty normal. We barely skipped a beat when I left for Vic - still texting pretty well daily and calling when we could. You tried to put the breaks on at one point, which I smoothly (and with impeccable grace) manipulated you into thinking was a bad idea. Thank god you’re so gullible ;) I’m so glad we stuck it through, continued to make effort to call, continued to learn about one another even though we weren’t in person. Back then, months of long distance seemed like an eternity, but I know now that we’re going to make up for it and then some when we’re finally reunited this year. It’s like you said at Ben’s during the summer when I made that comment about either one of us being ‘the one who got away’: You gotta fight for what you know is right. I took this to heart because, as usual, you were right. Relationships are not always easy, they aren’t meant to be. It’s hard enough thinking about our own needs and emotions, let alone another person. But when you find the right person, it’s sooooo worth it. Having a partner to rely on when making tough decisions. Someone who’s unconditionally supportive and simultaneously unafraid to give hard-hitting advice when needed. Someone to show love and to receive it. Someone to share life’s experience alongside. Someone who doesn’t judge and someone to laugh the night away with. Luckily, I’ve found my person, which is honestly something I thought I might never say.</p>

            <h1>The day we started dating</h1>
            <p>Going to visit you in Zeist is hands down one of the best decisions I’ve ever made in my life. Seeing you basically jump with joy when I got out of the cab, meeting many of your Utrecht friends, our love boat in Delft, going intergalactic for halloween, crushing winter house, making sushi, fucking on the stairs, and the couch, and back-to-back-to-back in your bed after I showed up… It was all so lovely. We both knew that we wanted to date, and honestly I’m so glad the way that we finally made it official. We basically asked the question together. Me beating around the bush (classic), you probably giving me shit for not saying what I’m thinking (classic), and us consummating our new relationship with our genitals (classic). I still remember the comment you made about being tired from constantly hosting people at your place, but that having me around was going to feel ‘like home’. I loved that comment. You’re such a comfort girl, and always want our home to be somewhere where you can come back, put your feet up, grab a crispy coke zero, smoke a J, and be completely yourself. If this time together in Zeist is a little glimpse into what life together will be like, then I want MORE!!</p>

            <h1>The first Christmas of many</h1>
            <p>I think I told you, the last couple Christmas season’s have been a little rough for me. Something about having time off where I’m expected to chill just doesn’t vibe with my brain. Don’t get me wrong, I love the holidays, but I often feel like I should be seizing the idle time for some self-betterment. But this Christmas was way different than before. I mean, it was hectic. We were running around trying to see and do everything that we hoped to do, not looking to let any of our friends down. But at the same time, I felt like I was exactly where I was supposed to be. I felt comfortable and filled with joy. I think part of what made this Christmas great was my horrendous trip back from BC. I had a lot of time to think and there was nothing I wanted more than to see my family and be wrapped in your arms. I’m so happy all went smoothly with hanging with each other’s parents and my grandparents. As my Dad said, ‘it feels very natural’. I agree, and that’s how it’s supposed to be. Let’s vow to make every future holiday season as incredible as it was in 2022.</p>

            <p>One of the things that I admire most about you is how you prioritize the people in your life. You value your friends and create opportunities to bond with them like no one I’ve met. It’s admirable. It’s also understandable, because your friends are all amazing people. You’ve chosen well and I got a glimpse of this at New Years. We may have come last place in the Babushka cup rankings, but we SMACKED the competition by taking home first place in the ‘back-to-back questions’ event and the ‘who can fuck the loudest on coke’ competition. Honestly Em, I am looking forward to a lifetime of weekends just like the one we had over New Years. I could not have asked for a better start to 2023. It’s OUR YEAR baby.</p>

            <h1>The future</h1>
            <p>Emily, you are my closest friend and I love you more than you could know. You’re a giving partner and you have a gift for creating fun from any situation. You’re a standup comedian - even sometimes at the detriment of our own body uhhhh death drops - and you believe that life is made to be enjoyed. Your humour and fun attitude is what I love most about you - aside from your academics of course. You are unauthentically yourself and you don’t back down from sharing your opinion if it needs to be heard, even if it may ruffle feathers. You read people like no one I’ve ever met, which I think is the basis for your psychic abilities (I’m a believer!). You challenge me, uplift me, and know me better than anyone else. You’re wickedly smart and have an outstanding moral compass, which is why you’re going to make a positive mark on the world. You are beautiful and you light up my whole body when you enter the room. You are the sexiest little pocket girl I’ve ever met, and girlie girlie girlie those hips, those double D’s, those mesmerizing eyes, it’s all working for me. You better be careful or we’re going to have a little Fika on our hands far earlier than planned. I love the way you value family and having a stable (but still fun and sexy) environment to raise our kids. You are going to be an amazing mother and wife one day - hypothetically. I can’t wait to grow together and build a life together Emily. Just promise me one thing: keep being yourself and know that there are no limits to what we can do together. You’re my best friend, the perfect partner, and you have a mind-bogglin’ booty. Nuff said, mic drop, Jim out. I love you.</p>
